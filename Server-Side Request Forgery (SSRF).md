# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
#OAST #Server-Side #SSRF

Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) allows an attacker to **induce** the server-side application to make **requests** to an **unintended** location.

Usually an attacker might cause the server to make a connection to **internal-only** services on the **network**. On the other hand, they may cause connections to **external** systems, potentially leaking **sensitive** data such as **authorization credentials**.
