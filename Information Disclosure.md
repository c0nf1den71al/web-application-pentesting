# Information Disclosure
#Information-Disclosure 

Information disclosure, also known as information leakage, is when a website **unintentionally** reveals **sensitive** information to its users. Examples of information which could be leaked may include:
-   Data about other users, such as **usernames** or **financial information**
-   Sensitive **commercial** or **business data**
-   **Technical** details about the **website** and its **infrastructure**

Examples of information disclosure include:
-   Revealing the names of **hidden directories**, their **structure**, and their **contents** via a `robots.txt` file or directory listing
-   Providing access to **source code files** via temporary backups
-   Explicitly mentioning **database table** or **column names** in error messages
-   Unnecessarily exposing highly sensitive information, such as **credit card details**
-   Hard-coding **API keys**, **IP addresses**, **database credentials**, and so on in the source code
-   Hinting at the existence or absence of **resources**, **usernames**, and so on via subtle differences in application behavior

## Disclosure Methods
### Error Messages
Error messages can be used to disclose information from web servers. Often **generating** a `404` may present the Apache version for example.

### Debug Page
Debug pages can expose environment variables or even consoles. 
Example debug page: `/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php`.

### User Account Pages
