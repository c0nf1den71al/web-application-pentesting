Clickjacking is an **interface-based** attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a **decoy website**.

The technique depends upon the incorporation of an **invisible**, **actionable** web page (or multiple pages) containing a **button** or **hidden link**, say, within an **iframe**. The iframe is overlaid on top of the user's anticipated decoy web page content. This attack differs from a [[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]] attack in that the user is required to perform an action such as a button click whereas a [[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]] attack depends upon **forging** an entire request without the user's knowledge or input.
