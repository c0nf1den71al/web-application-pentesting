# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
#OAST #Server-Side #SSRF

Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) allows an attacker to **induce** the server-side application to make **requests** to an **unintended** location.

Usually an attacker might cause the server to make a connection to **internal-only** services on the **network**. On the other hand, they may cause connections to **external** systems, potentially leaking **sensitive** data such as **authorization credentials**.

## Evading SSRF Defences
It is common to see applications containing SSRF behaviour together with defences aimed at **preventing** malicious exploitation. Often, these defences can be **circumvented**.

Different methods of writing `localhost`:
* `localhost`
* `127.0.0.1`
* `127.1`
* `2130706433`
* `017700000001`
*  `0x7f000001`
* `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net`

Some applications only allow input that matches, begins with, or contains, a **whitelist** of permitted values.

Different methods of evading white-list input filters:
|Technique|Example|
|---|---|
|Embedded Credentials|`https://expected-host@evil-host`|
|URL Fragmenting|`https://evil-host#expected-host`|
|DNS  Hierarchy Abuse|`https://expected-host.evil-host`|

## Blind SSRF
**Blind** SSRF vulnerabilities arise when an application can be induced to issue a **back-end** HTTP request to a supplied URL, but the response from the back-end request is not **returned** in the application's **front-end** response.
