# Access Control Vulnerabilities
#Access-Control #HTTP-Headers 

Broken access controls are a commonly encountered and often **critical** security vulnerability. Design and management of access controls is a complex and dynamic problem that applies **business**, **organizational**, and **legal** constraints to a technical implementation.

## Types Of Access Control
### Vertical Access Controls
Vertical access controls are used to **restrict** access to sensitive functionality that is not available to **other types** of users. For example, an administrator might be able to **delete** a users account whist regular users cannot do this.

### Horizontal Access Controls
Horizontal access controls are mechanisms that restrict access to **resources** to the users who are **specifically** allowed to access those resources. An example of this might include a user who can view their **own** account details but not the details of **other** users.

### Context-Dependent Access Controls
Context-dependent access controls restrict access to **functionality** and **resources** based on the state of the application or the users interaction with it. For example, a user can't modify the **contents** of their shopping cart **after** they have made a payment.

## Exploiting Broken Access Controls
### Vertical Privilege Escalation
If a user can gain access to functionality that they are not **permitted** to access then this is vertical privilege escalation. For example, if a **non-administrative** user can in fact gain access to an **admin** page where they can delete user accounts, then this is [vertical](Access%20Control%20Vulnerabilities.md#Vertical%20Access%20Controls) privilege escalation.

#### Unprotected Functionality
The most basic [vertical](Access%20Control%20Vulnerabilities.md#Vertical%20Access%20Controls) privilege escalation is when an application does not enforce **any** protection over sensitive functionality. An example of when this might occur is when a user can access the `http://insecure-website.com/admin` endpoint directly without authentication.

Admin panels can often be disclosed within the `robots.txt` file, however, in some cases **less predictable** URLs are used. Whilst this might not be guessable, URLs are often revealed in **source code**.

#### Parameter-Based Access Control
Some applications determine the user's role or privilege using a parameter. This could include a hidden field, cookie or within the URL.

This approach is insecure because a user can simply modify the value and gain access to function to which they are not authorised.
