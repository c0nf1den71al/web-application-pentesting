# Cross-Site Request Forgery
Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to **induce** users to perform actions that they **do not intend** to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to **prevent** different websites from interfering with each other.

## Request Types
### GET Requests
GET requests are usually the easiest to deliver. **GET parameters** within the URL are changed by the attacker and then delivered to the victim. When the user clicks the link, the request is then **executed**. 

Example GET URI: `https://example.com/email/change?email=attacker@evil.com`

### POST Requests
