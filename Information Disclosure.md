# Information Disclosure
#Information-Disclosure 

Information disclosure, also known as information leakage, is when a website **unintentionally** reveals **sensitive** information to its users. Examples of information which could be leaked may include:
-   Data about other users, such as **usernames** or **financial information**
-   Sensitive **commercial** or **business data**
-   **Technical** details about the **website** and its **infrastructure**

Examples of information disclosure include:
-   Revealing the names of **hidden directories**, their **structure**, and their **contents** via a `robots.txt` file or directory listing
-   Providing access to **source code files** via temporary backups
-   Explicitly mentioning **database table** or **column names** in error messages
-   Unnecessarily exposing highly sensitive information, such as **credit card details**
-   Hard-coding **API keys**, **IP addresses**, **database credentials**, and so on in the source code
-   Hinting at the existence or absence of **resources**, **usernames**, and so on via subtle differences in application behaviour

## Disclosure Methods
### Error Messages
Error messages can be used to disclose information from web servers. Often **generating** a `404` may present the Apache version for example.

### Debug Page
Debug pages can expose environment variables or even consoles. 
Example debug page: `/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php`.

### User Account Pages
Some pages may take a user as a **parameter** `/user/personal-info?user=carlos`. In this case there may not be **validation** and therefore, other users information can be **disclosed**.

### Backup Files
Often backup files can contain the **source code** and/or **API keys** for the **application**. Whilst PHP files are usually rendered, they can be **tricked** into displaying the plain text (for example `php://filter`)

### Insecure Configuration
Developers may **forget** to disable various debugging options in the production environment. For example, the HTTP `TRACE` method.

The HTTP `TRACE` method will echo the **exact** request that was received in the **response**. This is a common example of information disclosure.

### Version Control History
Sometimes, websites might expose their **version control data** in the `.git` folder.

If the folder is cloned, past changes can be viewed using `git log -p`. This may show **API keys** or **secrets** which were previously within the code.
