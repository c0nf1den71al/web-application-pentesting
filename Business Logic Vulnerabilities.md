# Business Logic Vulnerabilities
#Business-Logic #MFA

Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the **design** and **implementation** of an application that allow an attacker to elicit **unintended** behaviour. This potentially enables attackers to **manipulate** legitimate functionality to achieve a malicious goal.

## Examples Of Business Logic Vulnerabilities
### Excessive Trust In Client-Side Controls
A flawed assumption is that users will only interact with the application via the provided web interface. This is especially dangerous because it leads to further assumption that client-side validation will prevent users from supplying malicious input.

Accepting data at face value, without performing proper integrity checks and server-side validation, can allow an attacker to do high amounts of damage.
