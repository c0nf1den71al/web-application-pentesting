# Identifying Attacks
How to quickly identify and test for different attacks in your BSCP exam.

## Access Control Attacks
1. Can the login form be bypassed? (Go straight to /admin)
2. If authenticated can you change the user ID or username?
3. Can you submit a sensitive request but change the Referer header to where the request was suppose to come from?

## Authentication Vulnerabilities
1. User enumeration 
	* Are different error messages returned for right/wrong usernames?
	* Are there different response codes for right/wrong usernames?
	* Are the response times different for right/wrong usernames?
2. Brute-force
	* Can you brute-force password/MFA?
	* Can you brute force the stay-logged-in cookie
	* Can you crack the password offline?
	* Change IP using headers to avoid IP blocking
	* Correctly authenticate every other attempt to prevent lock-outs.
3. Is basic authentication being used? base64(username:password)
4. Can you bypass MFA pages?
5. Can you reset the users password but change the user?
6. Can you poison the password reset?

## Business Logic Vulnerabilities
1. Can you change the data type on inputs? How is this handled?
2. Can you provide a really big/small/negative input? How is this handled?
3. Is an encryption oracle present (something outputting encrypted data?)

## Clickjacking
1. Are X-Frame-Options or CSP enabled?
2. Can it be used to trigger DOM XSS?
3. Is a frame busting script in use? Can this be bypassed?

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
1. Can the Origin header be changed?
	* Try using `null`
	* Can you trick the header by changing the attacker url to extend the legitimate one? For example: `target.com.malicious.com`.
2. Is CORS in use?
3. Can you use CORS to access a Intranet

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
1. Is a CSRF token in use?
